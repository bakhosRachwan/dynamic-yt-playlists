# Dynamic YouTube Playlists

## Summary

- Users can sign into the app using their YouTube credentials. This will likely give us access to their channels/playlists so we can build out a UI
- A user can designate any playlist they want as the dynamic playlist. They then select the channels they want to be on that playlist
- When a creator publishes a new video, that video will automatically be added to the playlist designated.
- An alternate approach is to just retain the users in the app and not update anything on YouTubes side (maybe we make the YouTube direct playlist a premium feature?)
Example

This is a prime example of what I would use this for personally; 

- I create a playlist called “Destiny Content”
- I select the channels who’s content I want on that playlist. Lets say one of them is Aztecross.
- When Aztecross publishes a new video, that video will automatically be added to the top of the playlist
- Alternatively, there is a sorted list of videos in the app that I can auto play throug
